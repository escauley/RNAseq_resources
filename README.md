# RNAseq resources

These are guides to performing RNA-seq analysis in R from a workshop held by the NIH common fund in June of 2021. 

The Day 1 guide was made in markdown (suffix '.md') so can be viewed on Github.

The Day 2 guide was made in html (suffix '.html') so must be downloaded, and then opened through a web browser in order to view. 

TIP:
You can render the pages in this repo directly in the browser by prepending the following snippet to the URL:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?

For example, the Day 2 page would look like this:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/escauley/RNAseq_resources/main/RNA-Seq%20Differential%20Expression%20Analysis%20Day%202.html
