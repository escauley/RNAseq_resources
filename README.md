# RNAseq_resources

These are guides to performing RNA-seq analysis in R from a workshop held by the NIH common fund in June of 2021. 

The Day 1 guide was made in markdown (suffix '.md') so can be viewed on Github.

The Day 2 guide was made in html (suffix '.html') so must be downloaded, and then opened through a web browser in order to view.
